## [1.5.2] - 2017-03-27

### Fixed

- Queries to additional endpoints now return labels for values.

## [1.5.1] - 2017-03-24

### Fixed

- Timespan facet does not break anymore if its query returns undefined dates.

## [1.5.0] - 2017-03-15

### Added

- Checkbox facet (secoCheckboxFacet)

### Changed

- Simplified facet state update
- BasicFacet no longer does federated queries - a separate query for each
  service is produced instead.
- Multiple languages can now be given as the `preferredLang`.

## [1.4.1] - 2017-01-16

### Changed
- Values for the timespan facet are now cast as xsd:date in SPARQL

### Fixed
- Fix timespan facet date limits when selection changes

## [1.4.0] - 2017-01-11

### Changed
- Selecting a value in a basic facet does not update the list of selections anymore.
  This way the user can change the selection without clearing the selection first.
- Facet selections should now work with all literal datatypes.

## [1.3.2] - 2016-12-15

### Fixed
- Timespan facet selections restrictions fixed.

## [1.3.1] - 2016-11-15

### Fixed
- Sanitize the user's query in secoJenaTextFacet to avoid syntax errors from the
  SPARQL endpoint.

## [1.3.0] - 2016-11-15

### Changed
- secoJenaTextFacet allows for more user control in the search.
  I.e. it does not modify the user input except for excaping quotes
  (and removing them if they are unbalanced)
- secoJenaTextFacet default priority is now 0 (instead of 10).

## [1.2.1] - 2016-11-15

### Added
- `limit` and `graph` configuration options for secoJenaTextFacet.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-11-14

### Added
- [secoJenaTextFacet](http://semanticcomputing.github.io/angular-semantic-faceted-search/#/api/seco.facetedSearch.directive:secoJenaTextFacet)
- `priority` configuration variable to provide a way to sort the facet constraints (see the [documentation][api]).


## [1.1.1] - 2016-11-04

### Fixed
- Dates are hard. Dates should now appear the same in queries, URL params,
  and in the date picker, regardless of the user's timezone.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-11-03

### Changed
- Timespan facet now works as an actual facet by querying for minimum and maximum
  available dates, and adjusts the datepicker max and min dates accordingly.

## [1.0.7] - 2016-11-03

### Fixed
- Fix setting the timespan face's initial values.
- Fix an issue with the timespan facet where the selected date could be different
  from the one actually used in the query.

## [1.0.6] - 2016-11-02

### Added
- Changelog

### Changed
- UI Bootstrap dependency updated to ^2.2.0

### Fixed
- Fix the timespan facet, and its documentation
